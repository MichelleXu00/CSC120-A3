Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked to Hanyu and Rainbow while working on this assignment. 

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended the TA hours on Sunday afternoon and asked for help from Zihan.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I feel very frustrated about Java now. It is difficult to switch from Python to Java since there are a lot of differences and I cannot use pythontutor to check my code line by line. 

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The data types are the same in both languages. They both have loops, if statements, and return. The way of implement the ideas, the grammar, of the languages are different. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I don't know what to put in the constructor and printtranscript method. I wrote a basic frame for the chat method and respond method. I have an error in the respond method that I don't know how to fix. Try to look up syntax for loop and if statement for java online.
